<pre>
This is the I2C communication software for
I2C communication over RS232. 

This directory contains the linux source code. The subdirectory
linux_pre has a pre-compiled binary.

The software is also available for Windows (dos command line
utility), MacOS and Solaris. For details and pre-compiled
binaries see subdirectory other_OS.
Only windows requires a slightly modified source code. Mac and
Solaris can use the Linux source code.

i2c_rs232_pintest is a program to test the RS232 pins used for
the purpose of the I2C communication.

If you do not have anymore a RS232 port then just use a PL2303
(or similar) USB to rs232 connector.




I2C commands for the DC power supply:
=====================================

# set Imax to 0.20A:
i2ctalk i=20
# get current I value:
i2ctalk i
# store current settings
i2ctalk s
# set Umax to 2.1V:
i2ctalk u=21
# get current voltage value:
i2ctalk u
